To contribute, please submit a Pull Request. The only thing that we ask that you do 
is a very simple step, include a line modeled after this line:
        â€œDCO 1.1 Signed-off-by: Random J Developer &lt;random@developer.org&gt;"
as part of your pull request comments. By doing this one simple thing you are telling 
the community that you wrote the code you are contributing or have the right to pass 
on the code that you are contributing. If you are interested in the text of the 
DCO 1.1, you can find it [here](https://developer.ibm.com/open/developer-certificate-of-originality/ "DCO 1.1").

Thank you!
